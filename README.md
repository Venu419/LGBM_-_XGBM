# 🚀 LGBM & XGBM Titanic Survival Prediction 🏆

## 🎯 Objective
To compare the performance of **LightGBM** and **XGBoost** machine learning models for predicting survival on the Titanic dataset. The project includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and comparative analysis**.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **Titanic dataset**, which contains passenger details such as age, gender, ticket class, and survival status.

## 📌 Project Workflow

### 📊 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🔍 Load the Titanic dataset using `pandas`.
- ✅ Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
- 📈 Explore data distributions using **histograms and box plots**.
- 📊 Visualize relationships between features and survival using **scatter plots and bar plots**.

### 🛠 2. Data Preprocessing
- 🔄 Impute missing values for numerical and categorical features.
- 🔤 Encode categorical variables using **one-hot encoding** or **label encoding**.
- 📏 Perform feature selection and scaling (if required).

### 🤖 3. Model Building
- ✂️ Split the dataset into **training and testing** sets.
- 🏗 Train predictive models using **LightGBM** and **XGBoost**.
- 🎯 Choose evaluation metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score**.
- 🛠 Optimize models using **cross-validation** and **hyperparameter tuning**.

### ⚖️ 4. Comparative Analysis
- 📊 Compare the performance of **LightGBM** and **XGBoost** models.
- 📉 Visualize evaluation metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
- 🔬 Interpret results to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.

## ▶️ Usage
1. 📥 Clone the repository or download the files.
2. 📜 Run the Jupyter Notebook (`LGBM_&_XGBM.ipynb`) to execute the analysis.
3. 📊 View the results and model comparisons.

## 📌 Results & Insights
